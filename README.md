# K-NN-Smoother

Implement k-NN Smoother from scratch using Gaussian kernel and a fixed number of neighbors (k). Use Mahalanobis distance.


You will be applying K-fold cross-validation to tune the closest neighbors parameter k of your regressor. Write a function that randomly splits the given data into N many groups. Run your regressor for K=5(fold number) and k=2(neighbors number) on the wine quality data set. Report the mean absolute error for each fold.
